                    My name is Timothy Gentel, I was born in Brazil and moved to the United States when I was 14. Life was dramatically different here and I had a hard time adjusting to my new surrounding but I eventually go used to it. I did all the normal things in high school like join clubs played sports and i graduated with good grades. 
                    </p>
                    <P>     
                    After high school I wanted to keep paling soccer so i when to college. Although I quickly learned that I didnâ€™t want to spend another 4 plus years in school and have to pay for it, so I dropped out. I took a little time off but then my brother ,who is a developer, got me interested in coding witch lead me to here UT bootcamp. 
                    </P>
